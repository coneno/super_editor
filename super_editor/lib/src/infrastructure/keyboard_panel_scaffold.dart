  ///
  /// There are 3 possible visual states that are relevant to the bottom notch
  /// padding:
  ///
  ///  1. Regular UI - no keyboard visible, no keyboard panel visible.
  ///  2. Keyboard open.
  ///  3. Keyboard panel open (keyboard closed).
  ///
  /// When displaying regular UI (#1), content should be pushed up above the
  /// bottom notch so that it's clearly visible, and interactable. `SafeArea`
  /// does this for you by default. But we can't use `SafeArea` because the
  /// rules for when to apply bottom notch padding is different when showing
  /// keyboard panels. Therefore, users of this scaffold must apply this
  /// padding themselves. This property follows the rules needed for expected
  /// behavior when showing keyboard panels. Use this property instead of
  /// `SafeArea` and instead of `MediaQuery.paddingOf(context).bottom`.
  ///
  /// When displaying the keyboard (#2), the OS consumes its own notch height,
  /// so no additional padding is needed. If you push above the keyboard, then
  /// you automatically push above the notch. `SafeArea` does this automatically
  /// but we can't use `SafeArea` because the padding rules for the keyboard
  /// panel are different.
  ///
  /// The major difference we need to handle is when a keyboard panel is open (#3).
  /// This is the situation that Flutter doesn't handle correctly, because Flutter
  /// doesn't have a concept of keyboard panels. In the case of a keyboard panel,
  /// the keyboard is closed, but we don't want to push the content up above the
  /// notch. This is because the keyboard panel, itself, covers the notch. It's
  /// the same situation as when the keyboard is up, except the keyboard is closed
  /// and a keyboard panel is up. In this situation, we want bottom padding to
  /// be zero, instead of bottom padding that pushes above the notch.
