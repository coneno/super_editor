title: Build an Editor
---
In Super Editor, a document is typically represented by an instance of `MutableDocument`. The
easiest way to assemble a `MutableDocument` is by [de-serializing Markdown](/guides/markdown/import), or by
[de-serializing Quill Deltas](/guides/quill/import). However, there are situations where you might 
need to construct a `MutableDocument` directly. This guide shows you how.

## What is a Document?
In Super Editor, a `Document` is a series of nodes - specifically `DocumentNode`s. Different types of
`DocumentNode`s are available for different types of content, such as `ParagraphNode` and `ImageNode`.

Assembling a `Document` means assembling a list of desired `DocumentNode`s.

## Construct a `MutableDocument` with Content
The `MutableDocument` constructor accepts a list of `DocumentNode`s as initial content.

```dart
final document = MutableDocument(
  nodes: [
    ParagraphNode(
      id: Editor.createNodeId(),
      text: AttributedText(text: "Hello, world!"),
    ),
  ],
);
```

## Alter an existing `MutableDocument`
A `MutableDocument` can be altered after construction.

You can insert nodes.

```dart
document.insertNodeAt(1, ParagraphNode(
  id: Editor.createNodeId(),
  text: AttributedText(text: "New paragraph"),
),);
```

You can move nodes.

```dart
document.moveNode(nodeId: "node1", targetIndex: 2);
```

You can remove nodes.

```dart
document.deleteNodeAt(2);
```

In general you shouldn't directly alter a `MutableDocument` because the intention of a 
`MutableDocument` is to power an `Editor`. Once you give a `MutableDocument` to an `Editor`,
it's important that you only alter the document through `EditRequest`s to the `Editor`.
