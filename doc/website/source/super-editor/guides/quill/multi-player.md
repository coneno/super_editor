Quill Deltas are often used to implement multi-player (concurrent) editing.

Super Editor does not currently support the application of Deltas after the document
is created. You can only import a Quill Delta document when creating a new document.

Our team is open to building support for multi-player Quill Deltas, but none of our
funding clients have required this capability up to this point. If your team is
interested in funding multi-player Deltas, please reach out to to the
